/**
 Exercise 2:In this challenge, a farmer is asking you to tell him how many legs can be counted among all his animals.
 The farmer breeds three species:

 chickens = 2 legs
 cows = 4 legs
 pigs = 4 legs
 The farmer has counted his animals, and he gives you a subtotal for each species.
 You have to implement a function that returns the total number of legs of all the animals.
